Thoughts on Call Me By Your Name

I needed about 30 pages to realize the narrator was a guy!

Like many books, I was pretty sure I wasn't going to like the book and
only picked it up a few days later because I had nothing else to read
plus it was after all a 169 book club book and I didn't want to not be
part of the upcoming discussion.

Why had our May leader picked this book? It was getting more
"outrageous" by the minute!

But it grew on me. I finished. I disagree in a way that "nothing" ever
happened.

Both Oliver & Elio played mind games from the moment they met till the
end. I like books that tell you what the mind of the lead character is
thinking. The details of how every little action, response, possibility
etc. etc. could be interpreted was fascinating to me.

This is a "dirty" book for sure. And so is Nabokov's Lolita. As so is
Burroughs' Naked Lunch. I am not saying Aciman is their equal. The three
books are quite different, for sure, but the possible strange and often
conflicting ways lovers can evolve and think is presented in a way that
makes you cringe, laugh, cry, wonder.

I guess I wouldn't recommend the book and I'm looking forward to reading
the author I've just learned about from a member of my other book club.

I think Lolita is a believable love story. I just read that Naked Lunch
was a satire. How did I miss that!? Is Call Me By Your Name a bit of
both?

Reminds me of how everyone in my other club except Pat *loved" Backman's
Beartown. Too mean, violent, immoral, drugged up. The truth is tricky.
